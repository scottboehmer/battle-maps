# battle-maps

This repository contains svg files representing battlefield maps for tabletop wargames such as Warhammer 40,000.

The svg files are meant to be pretty basic to serve as a basis for customization. They scale inch measurements by 10, so a 60 inch long table will have a width of 600 in the svg files.
